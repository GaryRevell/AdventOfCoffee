# AdventOfCoffee

Submit PRs for your solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles of 2017 (http://adventofcode.com/).
The idea is to have one single directory per participating user, so please make one new directory for your personal use, put all your scripts into that very place and name the scripts according to `day_01.py`, `day_02.py` etc.
I will try to merge the PRs once a day.
